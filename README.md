Goal: To make downloading songs for Beat Saber from Beast Saber easier.

Rough Outline:

Add column ToDownload, filter, and use for download procedure

Add functionality to lookup if exists and if not add to allow for updated items, thus preserving ToDownload field data



**BeatSaber-Manager-Download**

Download desired songs that are marked ToDownload



**BeatSaber-Manager-Reswizzle**

Get SongName, SongTitle from ID3

Maybe - Rename Folder

Maybe - Option to remove custom color blocks

Maybe - Reformat info file
